# Snakes & Ladders

A game of snakes and ladders project

i just make different files for each modules using classes..i mean MainSnakes.py MainLadders.py MaindiceMove.py and then the compile everything into one file..
That is Main.py..this is the main file...

Now let's see about the code. This is the code I have made. A total of four players will play and I have given separate user input for
everything like coming down after a snake bite and climbing up a ladder.

Rules:
      1. Initally both the players are at starting position i.e. 0. 
         Take it in turns to roll the dice. 
         Move forward the number of spaces shown on the dice.
      2. If you lands at the bottom of a ladder, you can move up to the top of the ladder.
      3. If you lands on the head of a snake, you must slide down to the bottom of the snake.
      4. The first player to get to the FINAL position is the winner.
      5. Hit enter to roll the dice.
